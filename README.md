## Friendly Fridge

## Concept:

To keep the user up to date with the groceries in their fridge and defines the freshness for the user.

## Instructions:

The user would create an account then login the account to have their own personal fridge in the app. The fridge will be empty at first and the user can add groceries or food on a separate page. The app will ask for the name of what's being added and the expiration date. Once it has been added, it will be shown in your "my fridge" page.
